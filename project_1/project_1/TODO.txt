PENDING:
	-Add Light objects
	-Add Camera movement
	-Rework the Entity class to work with our new capabilities
		-Rework how shaders and materials work
			Use some kind of default texture?
			(I need to check how textures are working in detail)
	-Support multiple objects in a scene, or a scene, in general...
		-Add XYZ lines and maybe a gizmo?
	-Add Transparent objects in a different pass
BUGS:
