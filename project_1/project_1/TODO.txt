PENDING:
	-Add Light objects
	++++ Add Camera movement
	+ Try making the HyperDemon double camera effect
	-Rework the Entity class to work with our new capabilities
		-Rework how shaders and materials work
			Use some kind of default texture?
			(I need to check how textures are working in detail)
	-Support multiple objects in a scene, or a scene, in general...
		-Add XYZ lines and maybe a gizmo?
	-Add Transparent objects in a different pass
	-Generate a list of models to be rendered, separate from the entities list
		-Order it by shader.
OPTIMIZING:
	-Each entity is creating it's own version of the default shader, creating unnecessary glUseProgram calls

BUGS:

WISHLIST:
	Add a gizmo
	Add some gradient to the background (skybox shader?)
